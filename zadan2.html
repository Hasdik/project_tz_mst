					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has <br>been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took <br>a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five <br>centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was <br>popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of<br> Lorem Ipsum.
